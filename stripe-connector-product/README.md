# Stripe Connector

**Stripe** is a comprehensive **payment processing platform** that enables businesses to accept **online and in-person payments**. It provides a powerful API to integrate various payment methods, including **credit/debit cards, digital wallets, bank transfers**, and more.

We provide a **connector** that seamlessly integrates Stripe's functionality into a **business process**, enabling automated and efficient payment handling within Axon Ivy.

## Features of the Connector

### 1. Generating a Payment Link
- Based on **priceId** and **quantity**, a **payment link** can be generated.
- This link redirects the user to the secure **Stripe payment page**, where the payment can be completed.

### 2. Embedded Stripe Payment Form
- The Stripe payment form can be embedded directly into the **Axon Ivy UI**.
- This allows payments to be processed **within the application** without redirecting to Stripe.

## What is a Payment Link?
A **Payment Link** is a URL generated by Stripe that allows customers to make a payment directly. It contains predefined **prices and quantities** and enables seamless payment processing through various methods.

## What is the priceId?
The **priceId** is a unique identifier for a price in Stripe. It is automatically generated when a price is created for a product in the **Stripe Dashboard**. This **priceId** is used to correctly associate payments and can be utilized via the API or when creating a Payment Link.



## Demo

### Use Case: Create a paymentLink based on priceId and quantity
